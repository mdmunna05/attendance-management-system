🎓 RGUKT Attendance Management System (AWS-Serverless)
A secure, location-based attendance management system for RGUKT students built using AWS services, fully serverless, with Google Sign-In (restricted to @rguktsklm.ac.in), selfie-based verification using AWS Rekognition, and geolocation restriction.

🚀 Features
✅ Login with Google (@rguktsklm.ac.in only)
✅ Face Liveness + Face Match via AWS Rekognition
✅ Location-based attendance validation
✅ Student Registration with Selfie Upload
✅ Attendance submission via webcam selfie
✅ Serverless Architecture using AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Rekognition
✅ No Amplify | Pure AWS SDK + Hosted UI

🧠 How It Works

User Authentication

User lands on login.html which redirects to Amazon Cognito Hosted UI.
Google Sign-In is enabled and restricted to @rguktsklm.ac.in.
Unauthorized users are redirected to denied.html.

Registration

New users are redirected to register.html.
They fill details like Name, Student ID, Branch, Year, Section.
Upload a selfie with Rekognition Liveness Detection.

On form submit:

Selfie is uploaded to Amazon S3
All form data + S3 image URL is stored in Amazon DynamoDB
Rekognition Face Collection is updated with the user’s face
Redirected to attendance.html.

Attendance

Users upload a new selfie via webcam (with liveness check).
User's current location is verified (only allowed from college coordinates).
AWS Rekognition compares the new selfie with the registered image.
If match → attendance recorded → redirect to success.html.



Lambda & Backend

All backend logic is handled by AWS Lambda functions:
Form submission
S3 uploads
DynamoDB writes
Rekognition comparison
Location check
Communication is through API Gateway endpoints (no Amplify).
